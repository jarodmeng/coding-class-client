# Cursor Prompt Cheatsheet (Winston + Ido)

Use these prompts to keep Cursor helpful *without* burning free-tier usage.

## Debug (best)
> This is my script and my error. Fix it with the smallest change and explain like I'm 10.

## Make a small feature
> Add this feature in the simplest way. Don't change anything else.

## Learn (tiny challenge)
> Give me a tiny challenge using `Touched`, but don't give the answer.

## Improve readability
> Add short comments and better variable names, but keep the logic the same.
