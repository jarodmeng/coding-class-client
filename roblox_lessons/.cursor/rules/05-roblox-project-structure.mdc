# Roblox Project Structure (for Winston + Ido)

When giving instructions, ALWAYS say exactly where to put things in Roblox Studio:

## Where code goes
- **Server code** → `ServerScriptService` (use **Script**)
- **Player client code** → `StarterPlayer > StarterPlayerScripts` (use **LocalScript**)
- **UI code** → `StarterGui` (use **LocalScript** inside ScreenGui)
- **Shared modules** → `ReplicatedStorage` (ModuleScript)

## Naming
- Keep names simple: `Coin`, `Door`, `KillPart`, `FinishLine`
- Use folders when there are many objects: `Coins`, `Buttons`, `Doors`

## Always suggest a quick test
After any change, include one simple test:
- “Press Play → touch the coin → see if it disappears”
- “Check Output window for red errors”
