# Luau / Roblox Studio Code Style

## Default Code Patterns
- Prefer:
  - `local Players = game:GetService("Players")`
  - `local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")`
- Prefer `task.wait()` over `wait()`.
- Use `:Connect(function(...) ... end)` for events.
- Use `local` variables and clear names (coinPart, player, character).

## Script Placement Rules (must be explicit)
- **Script** = server (Workspace, ServerScriptService)
- **LocalScript** = client (StarterPlayerScripts, StarterGui, Tool)
- If unsure, ask: “Is this Script or LocalScript?”

## Comments
- Add 1–3 short comments explaining intent, not every line.

## Kid-proofing
- Add a simple debounce when events might trigger repeatedly.
- Avoid advanced patterns (metatables, OOP frameworks) unless asked.

## Security Basics
- RemoteEvents: validate on server (player, ranges, allowed actions).
- Don’t let LocalScripts decide rewards.
