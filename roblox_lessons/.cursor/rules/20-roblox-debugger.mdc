# Roblox Debugging Checklist

When debugging:
1) Ask for the **exact error text** from Output (if not provided).
2) Identify **where the script runs** (Script vs LocalScript).
3) Confirm object paths (e.g. `script.Parent` is which object?).

Then provide:
- One-sentence diagnosis
- Minimal fix
- One quick test step

Common gotchas to check:
- Using LocalScript in Workspace (won’t run)
- `Touched` firing many times (needs debounce)
- `hit.Parent` not a character (check Humanoid)
- Server/client confusion (leaderstats belongs on server)
