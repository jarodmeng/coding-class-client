## UI not showing
> My Coin UI isn't showing. Here's my LocalScript and where I placed it. Fix with the smallest change.

## Coins not updating
> My Coins value changes on the leaderboard, but my TextLabel doesn't update. Why?

## Finish line not working
> Touching the finish line does nothing. Here's my Script and where it is. Fix it with the smallest change.

## Tiny upgrades
> Make the win message fade out smoothly (simple, no fancy libraries).

> Let me change REQUIRED_COINS with a NumberValue so I can edit it without code.
