# Cursor Prompt Cheatsheet (Lesson 2)

## If lava doesn't kill
> Here is my lava script. It doesn't kill me when I touch it. What's wrong? Fix with the smallest change.

## If checkpoints don't work
> I created a Folder named Checkpoints with SpawnLocations, but I still respawn at the start. Fix my setup steps.

## Tiny upgrades
> Make the checkpoint briefly flash when activated. Keep it simple.

> Add a sound effect when I touch a checkpoint. Keep it simple.
